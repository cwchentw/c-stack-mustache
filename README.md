# Generic C code with Mustache templates.

This repo demonstrates how to use a template language like Mustache to generate generic code for C language.

We made the templates for the header and the code of a stack, from which generated valid C code. Then, we tested against the generted C code with two test programs; one with `int` and the other with a wrapper of `int`.

## System Requirements

* A modern C compiler
